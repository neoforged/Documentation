# Saved Data

The Saved Data (SD) system can be used to save additional data on levels.

_If the data is specific to some block entities, chunks, or entities, consider using a [data attachment](attachments) instead._

## Declaration

Each SD implementation must subtype the `SavedData` class. There are two important methods to be aware of:

- `save`: Allows the implementation to write NBT data to the level.
- `setDirty`: A method that must be called after changing the data, to notify the game that there are changes that need to be written. If not called, `#save` will not get called and the original data will remain unchanged.

## Attaching to a Level

Any `SavedData` is loaded and/or attached to a level dynamically. As such, if one is never created on a level, then it will not exist.

`SavedData`s are created and loaded from the `DimensionDataStorage`, which can be accessed by calling either `ServerChunkCache#getDataStorage` or `ServerLevel#getDataStorage`. From there, you can get or create an instance of your SD by calling `DimensionDataStorage#computeIfAbsent`. This will attempt to get the current instance of the SD if present or create a new one and load all available data.

`DimensionDataStorage#computeIfAbsent` takes in two arguments. The first is an instance of `SavedData.Factory`, which consists of a supplier to construct a new instance of the SD and a function to load NBT data into a SD and return it. The second argument is the name of the `.dat` file stored within the `data` folder for the implemented level. The name must be a valid filename and can not contain `/` or `\`.

For example, if a SD was named "example" within the Nether, then a file would be created at `./<level_folder>/DIM-1/data/example.dat` and would be implemented like so:

```java
// In some class
public ExampleSavedData create() {
  return new ExampleSavedData();
}

public ExampleSavedData load(CompoundTag tag, HolderLookup.Provider lookupProvider) {
  ExampleSavedData data = this.create();
  // Load saved data
  return data;
}

// In some method within the class
netherDataStorage.computeIfAbsent(new Factory<>(this::create, this::load), "example");
```

If a SD is not specific to a level, the SD should be attached to the Overworld, which can be obtained from `MinecraftServer#overworld`. The Overworld is the only dimension that is never fully unloaded and as such makes it perfect to store multi-level data on.
