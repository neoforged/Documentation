Mixin Class
===========

A mixin class is a special class that contains mixin codes that be applied to its target class. A mixin class can only have one target class, which is designated by the class annotation ```@Mixin```.

None of the mixin classes will be instantiated, as they will only be compiled to bytecodes and then applied in target classes. Therefore, the mixin classes can be abstract.

Here is an example of a mixin class.

```java
@Mixin(TargetClass.class)
public abstract class TargetClassMixin {

}
```
All mixin classes must be specified in the mixin config file like this, either for the client side only or both sides. Otherwise, they will not take any effects.

```json
{
  "required": true,
  "package": "com.example.modid.mixin",
  "compatibilityLevel": "JAVA_17",
  "minVersion": "0.8",
  "refmap": "modid.refmap.json",
  "plugin": "com.example.modid.mixin.MixinPlugin",
  "mixins": [
    "TargetClassMixin"
  ],
  "client": [

  ],
  "injectors": {
    "defaultRequire": 1
  }
}
```
