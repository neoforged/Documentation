Mixin
=====

:::danger
Before we start, we shall recommend you use [Events][events] instead of Mixin as it provides a safer way to inject your code. You should consider using Mixin if and only if you cannot find any satisfied Event and you must edit vanilla Minecraft codes.
:::

[SpongePowered Mixin][mixin_github] is a trait/mixin and bytecode weaving framework for Java using ASM. You can "edit" Minecraft vanilla codes and inject your own codes into Minecraft through Mixin.
