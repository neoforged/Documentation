# NeoForge User Guide

## Introduction

Whether you are a regular player, pack developer or server administrator, this guide is intended to help you through the process of preparing your computer to run NeoForge, as well as answer some frequently asked questions.

## Prerequisites

In order to install Neoforge, you will first need to have Java installed on your computer.

If you are unsure whether you already have Java installed, proceed to the [Checking for and Installing Java] section.

Otherwise, continue on to the [Installing NeoForge] section.

## Further Help

The NeoForged project has a [Discord] server, including a `#user-support` channel, where you can ask questions and seek further support.
