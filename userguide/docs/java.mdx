# Checking for and Installing Java

This section provides instructions on how to check your computer for an existing Java installation.

If you are sure that you do not already have Java installed, you can skip to the [Installing Java] section below.

## Checking for Existing Java Installation

To find out if you already have Java you can use the terminal application provided by your OS.

### Locating a Terminal Application

<Tabs defaultValue="windows">
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">
    Windows has three options depending on version:
    - Windows Terminal
    - PowerShell
    - Command Prompt (aka `cmd`)
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="macos" label="macOS">
    macOS has Terminal which is often found on the Finder dock.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
    The names for terminal applications vary on Linux but one of the following should be available from your distribution's main menu:
    - GNOME Terminal (or just Terminal)
    - Konsole
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Testing for Installed Java Version

Once you have located the terminal application for your OS, run the command `java -version`, which should present you with information similar to the following:

```
openjdk version "21.0.4" 2024-07-16 LTS
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Temurin-21.0.4+7 (build 21.0.4+7-LTS)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Temurin-21.0.4+7 (build 21.0.4+7-LTS, mixed mode, sharing)
```

## Installing Java

Minecraft itself recommends the [Microsoft Build of OpenJDK] (Microsoft JDK) for running Minecraft.

<!-- With Windows being the common case, should there be a `WinGet` example? -->

If you do not want to use the Microsoft JDK, you can instead donwload an installer for, e.g. Temurin from the Eclipse Foundation, from [Adoptium].

### Which Version of Java to Install

You will need to install a specific version of Java depending on the version of NeoForge you are installing.

The following table lists the versions of Java that are recommended for a particular version of minecraft:

| Minecraft version | Java version |
|-------------------|--------------|
| 1.20.2 - 1.20.4   | 17           |
| 1.20.5 and above  | 21           |

<!-- Above are minumium versions from the MC Wiki; check that these are optimal -->
