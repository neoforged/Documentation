# Built-In Data Maps

NeoForge provides various built-in [data maps][datamap] for common use cases, replacing hardcoded vanilla fields. Vanilla values are shipped by data map files in NeoForge, so there is no functional difference to the player.

## `neoforge:compostables`

Allows configuring composter values, as a replacement for `ComposterBlock.COMPOSTABLES` (which is now ignored). This data map is located at `neoforge/data_maps/item/compostables.json` and its objects have the following structure:

```json5
{
    // A 0 to 1 (inclusive) float representing the chance that the item will update the level of the composter
    "chance": 1,
    // Optional, defaults to false - whether farmer villagers can compost this item
    "can_villager_compost": false
}
```

Example:

```json5
{
    "values": {
        // Give acacia logs a 50% chance that they will fill a composter
        "minecraft:acacia_log": {
            "chance": 0.5
        }
    }
}
```

## `neoforge:furnace_fuels`

Allows configuring item burn times. This data map is located at `neoforge/data_maps/item/furnace_fuels.json` and its objects have the following structure:

```json5
{
    // A positive integer representing the item's burn time in ticks
    "burn_time": 1000
}
```

Example:

```json5
{
    "values": {
        // Give anvils a 2 seconds burn time
        "minecraft:anvil": {
            "burn_time": 40
        }
    }
}
```

:::info
NeoForge additionally adds the `IItemExtension#getBurnTime` method to be overridden in custom items, overruling this data map. `#getBurnTime` should only be used in scenarios where the datamap does not suffice, for example [data component][datacomponent]-dependent burn times.
:::

:::warning
Vanilla adds an implicit burn time of 300 ticks (15 seconds) for `#minecraft:logs` and `#minecraft:planks`, and then hardcodes the removal of crimson and warped items from that. This means that if you add another non-flammable wood, you should add a removal for that wood type's items from this map, like so:

```json5
{
    "replace": false,
    "values": [
        // values here
    ],
    "remove": [
        "examplemod:example_nether_wood_planks",
        "#examplemod:example_nether_wood_stems",
        "examplemod:example_nether_wood_door",
        // etc.
        // other removals here
    ]
}
```

## `neoforge:monster_room_mobs`

Allows configuring the mobs that may appear in the mob spawner in a monster room, as a replacement for `MonsterRoomFeature#MOBS` (which is now ignored). This data map is located at `neoforge/data_maps/entity_type/monster_room_mobs.json` and its objects have the following structure:

```json5
{
    // The weight of this mob, relative to other mobs in the datamap
    "weight": 100
}
```

Example:

```json5
{
    "values": {
        // Make squids appear in monster room spawners with a weight of 100
        "minecraft:squid": {
            "weight": 100
        }
    }
}
```

## `neoforge:oxidizables`

Allows configuring oxidation stages, as a replacement for `WeatheringCopper#NEXT_BY_BLOCK` (which will be ignored in 1.21.2). This data map is also used to build a reverse deoxidation map (for scraping with an axe). It is located at `neoforge/data_maps/block/oxidizables.json` and its objects have the following structure:

```json5
{
    // The block this block will turn into once oxidized
    "next_oxidized_stage": "examplemod:oxidized_block"
}
```

:::note
Custom blocks must implement `WeatheringCopperFullBlock` or `WeatheringCopper` and call `changeOverTime` in `randomTick` to oxidize naturally.
:::

Example:

```json5
{
    "values": {
        "mymod:custom_copper": {
            // Make a custom copper block oxidize into custom oxidized copper
            "next_oxidized_stage": "mymod:custom_oxidized_copper"
        }
    }
}
```

## `neoforge:parrot_imitations`

Allows configuring the sounds produced by parrots when they want to imitate a mob, as a replacement for `Parrot#MOB_SOUND_MAP` (which is now ignored). This data map is located at `neoforge/data_maps/entity_type/parrot_imitations.json` and its objects have the following structure:

```json5
{
    // The ID of the sound that parrots will produce when imitating the mob
    "sound": "minecraft:entity.parrot.imitate.creeper"
}
```

Example:

```json5
{
    "values": {
        // Make parrots produce the ambient cave sound when imitating allays
        "minecraft:allay": {
            "sound": "minecraft:ambient.cave"
        }
    }
}
```

## `neoforge:raid_hero_gifts`

Allows configuring the gift that a villager with a certain `VillagerProfession` may gift you if you stop the raid, as a replacement for `GiveGiftToHero#GIFTS` (which is now ignored). This data map is located at `neoforge/data_maps/villager_profession/raid_hero_gifts.json` and its objects have the following structure:

```json5
{
    // The ID of the loot table that a villager profession will hand out after a raid
    "loot_table": "minecraft:gameplay/hero_of_the_village/armorer_gift"
}
```

Example:

```json5
{
    "values": {
        "minecraft:armorer": {
            // Make armorers give the raid hero the armorer gift loot table
            "loot_table": "minecraft:gameplay/hero_of_the_village/armorer_gift"
        }
    }
}
```

## `neoforge:vibration_frequencies`

Allows configuring the sculk vibration frequencies emitted by game events, as a replacement for `VibrationSystem#VIBRATION_FREQUENCY_FOR_EVENT` (which is now ignored). This data map is located at `neoforge/data_maps/game_event/vibration_frequencies.json` and its objects have the following structure:

```json5
{
    // An integer between 1 and 15 (inclusive) that indicates the vibration frequency of the event
    "frequency": 2
}
```

Example:

```json5
{
    "values": {
        // Make the splash in water game event vibrate on the second frequency
        "minecraft:splash": {
            "frequency": 2
        }
    }
}
```

## `neoforge:waxables`

Allows configuring the block a block will turn into when waxed (right clicked with a honeycomb), as a replacement for `HoneycombItem#WAXABLES` (which will be ignored in 1.21.2). This data map is also used to build a reverse dewaxing map (for scraping with an axe). It is located at `neoforge/data_maps/block/waxables.json` and its objects have the following structure:

```json5
{
    // The waxed variant of this block
    "waxed": "minecraft:iron_block"
}
```

Example:

```json5
{
    "values": {
        // Make gold blocks turn into iron blocks once waxed
        "minecraft:gold_block": {
            "waxed": "minecraft:iron_block"
        }
    }
}
```
