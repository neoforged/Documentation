# Access Transformers

Access Transformers (ATs for short) allow for widening the visibility and modifying the `final` flags of classes, methods, and fields. They allow modders to access and modify otherwise inaccessible members in classes outside their control.

The [specification document][specs] can be viewed on the NeoForged GitHub.

## Adding ATs

Adding an Access Transformer to your mod project is as simple as adding a single line into your `build.gradle`:

<Tabs defaultValue="latest">
<TabItem value="latest" label="Latest">
Access Transformers need to be declared in both `build.gradle` and `mods.toml`:

```groovy
// In build.gradle:
// This block is where your mappings version is also specified
minecraft {
  accessTransformers {
    file('src/main/resources/META-INF/accesstransformer.cfg')
  }
}
```

```toml
# In mods.toml:
[[accessTransformers]]
file="META-INF/accesstransformer.cfg"
```

AT files can be anywhere specified by the lines above, though NeoForge will default to searching for `META-INF/accesstransformer.cfg` if no other file is specified.

Additionally, multiple AT files can be specified and will be applied in order. This can be useful for larger mods with multiple packages.

```groovy
// In build.gradle:
minecraft {
  accessTransformers {
    file('src/main/resources/accesstransformer_main.cfg')
    file('src/additions/resources/accesstransformer_additions.cfg')
  }
}
```

```toml
# In mods.toml
[[accessTransformers]]
file="accesstransformer_main.cfg"

[[accessTransformers]]
file="accesstransformer_additions.cfg"
```

After adding or modifying any Access Transformer, the Gradle project must be refreshed for the transformations to take effect.
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="1.20.1" label="1.20.1-47.1 and older">
Adding an Access Transformer to your mod project is as simple as adding a single line into your `build.gradle`:

```groovy
// This block is where your mappings version is also specified
minecraft {
  accessTransformer = file('src/main/resources/META-INF/accesstransformer.cfg')
}
```

During development, the AT file can be anywhere specified by the line above. However, when loading in a non-development environment, NeoForge will only search for the exact path of `META-INF/accesstransformer.cfg` in your JAR file.

After adding or modifying the Access Transformer, the Gradle project must be refreshed for the transformations to take effect.

## Comments

All text after a `#` until the end of the line will be treated as a comment and will not be parsed.

## Access Modifiers

Access modifiers specify to what new member visibility the given target will be transformed to. In decreasing order of visibility:

- `public` - visible to all classes inside and outside its package
- `protected` - visible only to classes inside the package and subclasses
- `default` - visible only to classes inside the package
- `private` - visible only to inside the class

A special modifier `+f` and `-f` can be appended to the aforementioned modifiers to either add or remove respectively the `final` modifier, which prevents subclassing, method overriding, or field modification when applied.

:::danger
Directives only modify the method they directly reference; any overriding methods will not be access-transformed. It is advised to ensure transformed methods do not have non-transformed overrides that restrict the visibility, which will result in the JVM throwing an error.

Examples of methods that can be safely transformed are `private` methods, `final` methods (or methods in `final` classes), and `static` methods.

## Targets and Directives

### Classes
To target classes:
```
<access modifier> <fully qualified class name>
```
Inner classes are denoted by combining the fully qualified name of the outer class and the name of the inner class with a `$` as separator.

### Fields
To target fields:
```
<access modifier> <fully qualified class name> <field name>
```

### Methods
Targeting methods require a special syntax to denote the method parameters and return type:
```
<access modifier> <fully qualified class name> <method name>(<parameter types>)<return type>
```

#### Specifying Types

Also called "descriptors": see the [Java Virtual Machine Specification, SE 8, sections 4.3.2 and 4.3.3][jvmdescriptors] for more technical details.

- `B` - `byte`, a signed byte
- `C` - `char`, a Unicode character code point in UTF-16
- `D` - `double`, a double-precision floating-point value
- `F` - `float`, a single-precision floating-point value
- `I` - `integer`, a 32-bit integer
- `J` - `long`, a 64-bit integer
- `S` - `short`, a signed short
- `Z` - `boolean`, a `true` or `false` value
- `[` - references one dimension of an array
  - Example: `[[S` refers to `short[][]`
- `L<class name>;` - references a reference type
  - Example: `Ljava/lang/String;` refers to `java.lang.String` reference type _(note the use of slashes instead of periods)_
- `(` - references a method descriptor, parameters should be supplied here or nothing if no parameters are present
 - Example: `<method>(I)Z` refers to a method that requires an integer argument and returns a boolean
- `V` - indicates a method returns no value, can only be used at the end of a method descriptor
  - Example: `<method>()V` refers to a method that has no arguments and returns nothing

## Examples

```
# Makes public the ByteArrayToKeyFunction interface in Crypt
public net.minecraft.util.Crypt$ByteArrayToKeyFunction

# Makes protected and removes the final modifier from 'random' in MinecraftServer
protected-f net.minecraft.server.MinecraftServer random

# Makes public the 'makeExecutor' method in Util,
# accepting a String and returns an ExecutorService
public net.minecraft.Util makeExecutor(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/util/concurrent/ExecutorService;

# Makes public the 'leastMostToIntArray' method in UUIDUtil,
# accepting two longs and returning an int[]
public net.minecraft.core.UUIDUtil leastMostToIntArray(JJ)[I
