# BlockEntityRenderer

A `BlockEntityRenderer`, often abbreviated as BER, is used to render [blocks][block] in a way that cannot be represented with a [static baked model][model] (JSON, OBJ, others). For example, this could be used to dynamically render container contents of a chest-like block. A block entity renderer requires the block to have a [`BlockEntity`][blockentity], even if the block does not store any data otherwise.

To create a BER, create a class that inherits from `BlockEntityRenderer`. It takes a generic argument specifying the block's `BlockEntity` class, which is used as a parameter type in the BER's `render` method.

```java
// Assumes the existence of MyBlockEntity as a subclass of BlockEntity.
public class MyBlockEntityRenderer implements BlockEntityRenderer<MyBlockEntity> {
    // Add the constructor parameter for the lambda below. You may also use it to get some context
    // to be stored in local fields, such as the entity renderer dispatcher, if needed.
    public MyBlockEntityRenderer(BlockEntityRendererProvider.Context context) {
    }
    
    // This method is called every frame in order to render the block entity. Parameters are:
    // - blockEntity:   The block entity instance being rendered. Uses the generic type passed to the super interface.
    // - partialTick:   The amount of time, in fractions of a tick (0.0 to 1.0), that has passed since the last tick.
    // - poseStack:     The pose stack to render to.
    // - bufferSource:  The buffer source to get vertex buffers from.
    // - packedLight:   The light value of the block entity.
    // - packedOverlay: The current overlay value of the block entity, usually OverlayTexture.NO_OVERLAY.
    @Override
    public void render(MyBlockEntity blockEntity, float partialTick, PoseStack stack, MultiBufferSource bufferSource, int packedLight, int packedOverlay) {
        // Do the rendering here.
    }
}
```

Only one BER may exist for a given `BlockEntityType<?>`. Therefore, values that are specific to a single block entity instance should be stored in that block entity instance, rather than the BER itself.

When you have created your BER, you must also register it to `EntityRenderersEvent.RegisterRenderers`, an [event] fired on the [mod event bus][eventbus]:

```java
@SubscribeEvent
public static void registerEntityRenderers(EntityRenderersEvent.RegisterRenderers event) {
    event.registerBlockEntityRenderer(
            // The block entity type to register the renderer for.
            MyBlockEntities.MY_BLOCK_ENTITY.get(),
            // A function of BlockEntityRendererProvider.Context to BlockEntityRenderer.
            MyBlockEntityRenderer::new
    );
}
```

In the event that you do not need the BER provider context in your BER, you can also remove the constructor:

```java
public class MyBlockEntityRenderer implements BlockEntityRenderer<MyBlockEntity> {
    @Override
    public void render( /* ... */ ) { /* ... */ }
}

// In your event handler class
@SubscribeEvent
public static void registerEntityRenderers(EntityRenderersEvent.RegisterRenderers event) {
    event.registerBlockEntityRenderer(MyBlockEntities.MY_BLOCK_ENTITY.get(),
            // Pass the context to an empty (default) constructor call
            context -> new MyBlockEntityRenderer()
    );
}
```

## Item Block Rendering

As not all block entities with renderers can be rendered using static models, you can create a special renderer to customize the item rendering process. This is done using [`SpecialModelRenderer`s][special]. In these cases, both a special model renderer must be created to render the item correctly, and a corresponding registered special block model renderer for scenarios when a block is being rendered as an item (e.g., enderman carrying a block).

Please refer to the [client item documentation][special] for more information.
